## StayActive - Mouse Mover

**Disclaimer:** Using a program that simulates activity to avoid being marked as "away" or "AFK" on your computer may be against the policies of your organization or the services you're using. It is important to adhere to the rules and guidelines set by your employer or the platform you're using.

If you are looking to prevent your computer from entering sleep mode or locking the screen due to inactivity, you can simply adjust the power and sleep settings in Windows.

However, if you still want a simple C# console application that moves the mouse cursor periodically, here it is. Please use it responsibly and only for legitimate purposes.

## How to Use
1. Open **Visual Studio 2022** and create a new **Console App (.NET Framework)** project.
2. Set the target framework to **.NET Framework 4.7.2**.
3. Replace the contents of the `Program.cs` file with the provided code.
4. Build and run the application by pressing **F5**.

The application moves the mouse cursor by 1 pixel every 4 minutes to simulate activity. To stop the application, press Ctrl+C in the console window.

## Code
Refer to the provided code in the previous responses for the complete `Program.cs` file contents.

## Reminder
Use this application responsibly and within the boundaries of the rules set by your organization or the services you are using.
